## Ways to Contribute

### How to Report a Bug

#### **If you have a security concern, please contact us at what@factom.com.**

If you have found a bug, please open a github issue and include the following details:

* Use a clear and description title for your issue
* Steps to reproduce

### How to Request an Enhancement or Feature

#### Minor Requests

For minor requests, such as proposing a new RPC method, consider opening a github issue to discuss with other maintainers. Other fixes might be even more minor, such as fixing a typo or refactoring a few lines of code, you can simply open a pull request.

#### Major Requets

If you have an idea that will require a lot of attention and discussion, consider opening an issue to start the discussion before building and making a pull request. Alternatively, if you want to start less formal discussion of an idea, check out the `#developer-discussion` channel at our [discord server](https://discord.gg/SxPePjQ).

## Code Review Process

After you make your contribution, your work will be automatically tested. If your contribution fails this automatic test, read the CI logs to determine the cause and develop a patch. Your contribution may necessarily break tests, however, so please make a note to the maintainers about why your contribution will break tests. After automatic testing your work will be reviewed by other maintainers, including the lead maintainer. You might be asked to rebase your work on a different branch or update your working branch; or other assorted adjustments. Once your work has been reviewed it will be scheduled for a future release.

## Community

If you have questions or want to discuss ideas with other `factomd` developers, join us at the `#developer-discussion` channel at our [discord server](https://discord.gg/SxPePjQ). Other important discussions happen at factomize forums and in issues and PRs on github.
